# CryptoClustering
This repo documents my efforts against the TCC data analysis bootcamp's unsupervised learning homework challenge.

The challenge was to apply unsupervised learning ML techniques learned during week 19 to predict cryptocurrency valuation performance.

## Structure
All substantive content resides in the CryptoClustering folder. The file structure is as follows:

- CryptoClustering
    - Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
      - Jupyter notebook Python source code utilizing unsupervised ML techniques to predict cryptocurrency valuation performance
    - crypto_market_data.csv
      - Source data provided by TCC
